# R.E.M.E.D.Y.-Bot
R.E.M.E.D.Y. Bot is a Python program meant to emulate the idea of a virtual doctor tool using Discord as an interface to support accessibility for users. The program prompts users to list any symptoms they may have. Any symptoms they have that are related to a mild illness will recommend a remedy, often persistent on over-the-counter medication, to treat the illness directly. Further patches to the program will focus on improving efficiency and expanding general knowledge on disease and treatment. **A Discord Bot is required to run this program.**
