# R.E.M.E.D.Y.-Bot
R.E.M.E.D.Y. Bot is a Python program meant to emulate the idea of a virtual doctor tool. The program prompts users to list any symptoms they may have. Any symptoms they have that are related to a mild illness will recommend a remedy, often persistent on over-the-counter medication, to treat the illness directly. Further patches to the program will focus on improving efficiency and expadning general knowledge on disease and treatment.
